# Factorial-of-a-number-using-C-Programing

Factorial:-
Factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
For Example:-
Factorial of 5 = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
Similarly, 
Factorial of 6 = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720
Factorial of 7 = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040
and so on .....

Here in this code this logic is implemented
